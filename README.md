#### The Idea of this plugin is to provide a component that implements CPython codes inside grasshopper.
- It is pereferred that you download one of the bundles that include all the required python scientific libraries such as [Python(x,y)](https://python-xy.github.io/), [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
- You have to run Rhino as adminstrator at first. 

The following image shows CPython plugin(down right) , and the first implemented plugin (top right) and the code ide (left)

Add description, documentation to each input and output 
![documentations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6969514/29185199-d42dca46-7e08-11e7-89be-1e78e05fe14d.jpg)

Supports any version on Python. 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 ..

### How to choose between different Python interpreters? 
By clicking on the thin blue line at the bottom of any component, a new window will popup and you can choose your preferred interpreter from this window.

## What can and What can't it do?
### It can: 
1. Add as many input and output variables as needed. 
2. Change its name, NickName and discription.
3. Import all CPython modules such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy, etc..
4. Change Icon (simply drag a 24x24 pixel image to the component).
5. Save as user object. 
6. Create Rhino Geometry (in progress)
